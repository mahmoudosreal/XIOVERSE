# XIOVERSE
Pioneering AR/VR wearables, revolutionizing #NFT ownership.


## Project Overview:

XIOVERSE is a virtual reality and augmented reality NFT watch experience that transcends time and inspires change. The unique watches are designed to be collector's items, each unlocking a private virtual vault room with hidden treasures waiting to be discovered. Join the community of puzzle solvers and challenge yourself to unlock rewards and gain ultimate enlightenment. With designs inspired by iconic eras and themes, this experience is for the collectors, the dreamers, and the visionaries.

### **STORY**:

The XIOVERSE Eternals some call them, wanderers through time, the invisible hands that shape our world. Supernatural entities, born to exist in different eras, roam the earth looking to spread their influence and inspire change. Each entity crafted an artifact bestowed upon exceptional humans, artifacts that are doorways to vaults in their respective eras. A unique egg lies hidden within each vault. Find the egg in your artifact, complete the puzzle of the era with your fellow community, and gain access to the test of the ages. Will you choose greed, power, love, or empathy? Will you transcend through the ranks, help your community, and gain ultimate enlightenment? Enjoy the Xioverse experience.

### **XIOVERSE DNA**:

We capitalize on virtual reality to unleash creativity, pushing beyond the physical realm of possibilities. Why settle for the laws of physics, when we can be gods in a boundless virtual universe? We draw inspiration from iconic eras and themes, to design unique masterpieces, available in a very limited run. The XIOVERSE experience is one of a kind, bringing forth artistic genius, coupled with a strong community bond that shall last through continuous development and an intricate reward system.

### AR/VR:

XIOVERSE watches are uniquely designed 3D ethereal watches in Virtual Reality. They are watches for the collectors, the dreamers, the visionaries, the people aspiring for greatness, changing the world. The NFT holders could view the watch in VR or in AR mode projected onto their hands.

### **INSPIRATION THEMES**:

1000 WATCHES

10 ERAS

100 WATCHES PER ERA

-   PREHISTORY
-   EGYPTIAN MYTHOLOGY
-   NORDIC MYTHOLOGY
-   GREEK MYTHOLOGY
-   MEDIEVAL AGE
-   RENAISSANCE
-   INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
-   STEAMPUNK
-   CYBER PUNK
-   COSMOS

### **VAULT ROOM**:

Watch holders can experience in virtual reality their own unique vault rooms designed as to the corresponding watch theme. Every room holds a hidden egg. Finding the eggs unlocks rewards

### **REWARD SYSTEM**:

When all 100 eggs are found within 1 era the eraâ€™s silver key is released to 1 random watch holder within the unlocked era. A silver key holds a 1.5% commission on all cumulative watch sales within the corresponding era.

When all 1000 eggs are found throughout all eras 1 gold key is released to 1 random watch holder across all eras. A gold key holds a 1% commission on all cumulative watch sales within all eras.

"We will be releasing 1/1 edition watches and auctioning them off. Part of the auction returns will be shared with all Watch holders."

### Create Skins:

NFT holders can exchange their Xioverse tokens for a DNA extractor tool. The DNA extractor creates 10 skins based on the theme of the watch the NFT holder owns. NFT holders can sell their skins to owners of the collaboration watches, and make royalties on the trade of their skins.

## Role:

1.  The stage of creating the **Smart Contract** was rather fun. I benefited from the presence of some gaps and ideas that were constantly evolving. This helped me to test my ability to provide several types of smart contracts, and it was a test of my dynamism in accepting and normalizing technical changes and new rules and standards. Especially the standards that guarantee royalties to those in charge of the project
2.  The next phase proved to be equally arduous and demanding as the initial stage, where we had to construct the marketing website for the project. Specifically, we're referring to the concept of its aesthetic foundation and ensuring the alignment of ideas with the external appearance of each component. At present, the development of the website is being carried out with meticulousness and concentration, while still being mindful not to disregard the conventional NFT norms when building the marketing site for the xioverce initiative.
3.  The third stage is unequivocally the pinnacle of the project, and it's where my expertise comes into play. It involves fabricating a metaverse universe, blending puzzles, three-dimensional realms, and historical epochs with investment units, and formulating systems and sophisticated contracts that bestow and regulating authority to the token holders. This phase amalgamates web programming with mobile tech, smart contracts, and augmented reality, featuring fresh and ingenious designs that track specific areas of the human anatomy and attach priceless virtual components to them.
